`counterOne` and `counterTwo` are both loop control variables that control when the loop will terminate as well as the number of times the loop will execute before it terminates. In both examples above, the loop control value is incremented or decremented by a certain value every time the loop is executed. This step is required in the program because the loop will run forever if the condition always evaluates true.

Let's think back to Access Control and remember to consider the scope of the variables inside the loop. Any variable declared inside the `for` or `while` loop or inside the parenthesis of a `for` statement can only be used in the body of the loop. They cannot be printed or accessed in any way after the loop is terminated. If you look at the code above, there is a print statement in comments. If you uncomment the statement and run the program, it will cause an error because `counterTwo` cannot be referenced outside the `for` loop.
