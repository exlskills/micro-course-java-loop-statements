The code above contains two `while` statements, both followed by a block of code. A block is a group of statements enclosed within curly braces.

Let's examine the first `while` loop to see how the statement works. The expression inside the parenthesis is evaluated each time the loop is executed. If the result is "true", the `while` loop executes the statements. If the result is "false" the `while` loop terminates. So, if we were to explain the `while` loop in words: "while `exampleVariableOne` is less than or equal to 10, print the number and increment `exampleVariableOne` by one.

Make sure your `while` loop has a termination point after a certain amount of executions. Otherwise, the program will not run as intended and may crash.
