Let's learn and remember the loop syntax. The statements inside the parenthesis of a `for` loop can be split into three sections:

1. Initializing - initializes a new variable and assigns it a value
2. Control - the condition that is tested every time the loop executes. If the condition is "true", the loop continues to run. If the condition result is "false", the loop terminates.
3. Step - where you change the value of the initialized value by whatever is necessary. You may use assignment statements such as "+=" and "-=" or use increment/decrement. Feel free to go back and review those sections at any point.
