>>Consider the following code segment:

```
String varOne = "abcdef";
for (int count = 0; count < varOne.length()-1; count++){
  System.out.print(varOne.substring(count, count+2));
}
```

What is printed as a result of executing this code segment?<<

( ) abcdef {{Incorrect because "abbccddeef" is printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
( ) aabbccddeeff {{Incorrect because "abbccddeef" is printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
( ) abcbcdcdedef {{Incorrect because "abbccddeef" is printed. View the step-by-step solution below.}}
(x) abbccddeef {{Correct because it accurately represents what the for loop does and the number of times <code>varOne.substring(count, count+2);</code> is printed on the console.
<p>The process is shown below:</p>
When count = 0, <code>varOne.substring(0, 2)</code> = "ab"<br/>
When count = 1, <code>varOne.substring(1, 3)</code> = "bc"<br/>
When count = 2, <code>varOne.substring(2, 4)</code> = "cd"<br/>
When count = 3, <code>varOne.substring(3, 5)</code> = "de"<br/>
When count = 4, <code>varOne.substring(4, 6)</code> = "ef"<br/>
<p>Adding all these strings together, you end up with "abbccddeef", which is the correct answer.</p>}}
( ) Nothing is printed because an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown {{Incorrect because an error would not occur.}}

||<code>substring(x,y)</code> method includes the character at index 'x' but excludes the character at index 'y'. ||
