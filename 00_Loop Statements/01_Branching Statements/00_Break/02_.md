The `if` statement has the expression "count == 5", so when `count` has a value of 5 the statements inside the `if` statement will be executed, including the `break;` statement, which will terminate the `for` loop so any number after 5 will not be printed. `break;` does not affect the `if` statement, it terminates the whole loop. When the `break;` statement is used appropriately, it saves time when running the program because you wouldn't have to loop through the same statements over and over again.
