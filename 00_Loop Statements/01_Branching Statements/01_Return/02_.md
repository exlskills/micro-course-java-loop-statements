As you can see after running the code above, `return` breaks the loop and exits the method immediately after it is called. The statement `return "exampleVariableOne is never equal to 25";` is never called because `exampleVariableOne` will eventually reach 25 as it decreases from 100 to 0.

The `return` statement is useful because it saves time and makes the program run faster by returning the output of method without executing unnecessary code and loops. It is good practice to always have a `return` statement after the for/while loop in case the return statement inside the for/while loop is never executed. Otherwise, a compile-time error will occur because the method cannot return nothing (unless it has the Java reserved word "void" in the method header).
