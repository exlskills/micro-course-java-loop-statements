If the `if` statement was not in the code, the `while` loop would run indefinitely. This is because the boolean expression inside the parenthesis always return "true". For this reason, we must ensure that our boolean expressions have an end by making sure they return as "false" in order to end the loop.

Infinite loops can cause your computer/browser/application to pause due to the continuous executions of the program, or even crash. One way to debug infinite loops is to print out the loop control variable after running the statements inside the loop to check what the cause of the infinite loop is.
