As discussed previously, it is essential to make sure each loop you write has a distinct end. For example, if the condition inside the `for` or `while` loop is always true, the loop will run forever, creating an infinite loop. It is possible to accidentally create a loop that never ends. Look below to see how the `if` statement prevents the infinite loop from executing over 10 times.
